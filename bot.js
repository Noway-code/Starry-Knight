/* The fs
module is Node's native file system module. fs is used to read the commands directory and identify our command files.
The path
module is Node's native path utility module. path helps construct paths to access files and directories. One of the advantages of the path module is that it automatically detects the operating system and uses the appropriate joiners.
The Collection
class extends JavaScript's native Map class, and includes more extensive, useful functionality. Collection is used to store and efficiently retrieve commands for execution.
